# Sliding Window Practice Tasks

## Task 1: Maximum Sum Subarray of Size K
**Problem**: Given an array of integers and a number `K`, find the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray of size `K`.

**Input**:
- First line: Two integers `n` (size of the array) and `K`.
- Second line: `n` integers representing the array.

**Output**:
- A single integer representing the maximum sum.

---

## Task 2: Longest Subarray with Sum ≤ M
**Problem**: Given an array of integers and a number `M`, find the length of the longest contiguous subarray whose sum is less than or equal to `M`.

**Input**:
- First line: Two integers `n` (size of the array) and `M`.
- Second line: `n` integers representing the array.

**Output**:
- A single integer representing the length of the longest subarray.

---

## Task 3: Count Subarrays with Sum Exactly M
**Problem**: Given an array of integers and a number `M`, count the number of contiguous subarrays whose sum is exactly `M`.

**Input**:
- First line: Two integers `n` (size of the array) and `M`.
- Second line: `n` integers representing the array.

**Output**:
- A single integer representing the count of subarrays.

---

## Task 4: Smallest Subarray with Sum ≥ M
**Problem**: Given an array of integers and a number `M`, find the length of the smallest contiguous subarray whose sum is greater than or equal to `M`. If no such subarray exists, return `-1`.

**Input**:
- First line: Two integers `n` (size of the array) and `M`.
- Second line: `n` integers representing the array.

**Output**:
- A single integer representing the length of the smallest subarray or `-1`.

---

## Task 5: Distinct Elements in Every Subarray of Size K
**Problem**: Given an array of integers and a number `K`, find the number of distinct elements in every contiguous subarray of size `K`.

**Input**:
- First line: Two integers `n` (size of the array) and `K`.
- Second line: `n` integers representing the array.

**Output**:
- A single line containing `n-K+1` integers, where each integer represents the count of distinct elements in the corresponding subarray.

---

## Task 6: Maximum Product Subarray
**Problem**: Given an array of integers, find the maximum product of any contiguous subarray.

**Input**:
- First line: An integer `n` (size of the array).
- Second line: `n` integers representing the array.

**Output**:
- A single integer representing the maximum product.

---

## Task 7: Longest Substring with At Most K Distinct Characters
**Problem**: Given a string and an integer `K`, find the length of the longest substring that contains at most `K` distinct characters.

**Input**:
- First line: A string `s`.
- Second line: An integer `K`.

**Output**:
- A single integer representing the length of the longest substring.

---

## Task 8: Minimum Window Substring
**Problem**: Given two strings `s` and `t`, find the minimum window in `s` which will contain all the characters in `t`. If no such window exists, return an empty string.

**Input**:
- First line: A string `s`.
- Second line: A string `t`.

**Output**:
- A single string representing the minimum window or an empty string if no such window exists.

---

### Notes:
- Each task can be solved using the sliding window technique.
- Test your solutions with edge cases, such as empty arrays, single-element arrays, or arrays with all identical elements.
